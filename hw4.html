        <p align ="left">The Hyundai Creta has long been a dominant force in Nepal<sup>'</sup>s compact SUV market,<br>
         winning buyers over with its strong design, practicality, and reliability. Now, Hyundai is<br>
          electrifying this successful nameplate with the launch of the Creta Electric. Although it<br>
           enters Nepal<sup>'</sup>s EV segment a little later than some rivals, the Creta Electric brings a<br>
            compelling blend of performance, range, and technology. However, it faces stiff<br>
             competition from established Chinese EV players like BYD and MG, who have already <br>
             carved out a significant presence in the market.
            <br>

       <b> Power, Performance, and Range</b>

        The Creta Electric is available in two battery configurations. The larger 51.4 kWh battery<br>
         delivers an impressive 126 kW (168 bhp) of power and boasts an ARAI-certified range of 473 km,<br>
          making it ideal for long commutes and highway travel. For those looking for a more budget-friendly<br>
           option, the smaller 42 kWh battery generates 99 kW (132 bhp) and offers a range of 390 km. <br>
           Despite being an electric SUV, the Creta Electric delivers swift acceleration, <br>
           reaching 0-100 km/h in just 7.9 seconds. To ensure consistent performance, <br>
           especially in colder conditions, Hyundai has equipped it with a battery heater,<br>
            optimizing efficiency across different climates. Both battery variants of the<br>
             Creta Electric are powered by  NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) battery technology,<br>
              which is known for  providing a balance of high energy density, longer life,<br>
               and greater efficiency,contributing to both the vehicle<sup>'</sup>s range and performance.</p></font>
